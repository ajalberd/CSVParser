# CSVParser
A small Python program to convert a 2-column CSV into a 2-D array, with column 1 being the filename and column 2 being the data. Creates X text files, where X is the amount of rows.

I used it to create ~1000 text files of different lab runs for a friend. I attached the csv to use. Simply rename the file if needed in the program, as it does not prompt for a filename.
